                <h2>Before Terraforming</h2>
                <p>Prior to terraforming, the conditions on Acheron were very harsh. It had no indigenous ecosystems and
                    couldn't support human life. The surface was volcanic, with a cold and toxic atmosphere of mainly
                    nitrogen and COâ‚‚.</p>

                <h2>After Terraforming</h2>
                <p>The atmosphere became more breathable, but it remained a dim, desolate environment with harsh winds.
                    A terraforming colony known as Hadley's Hope made Acheron livable for a brief time. However,
                    following the colony's destruction, terraforming halted and no humans have settled here for hundreds
                    of years.</p>

                <h2>Acheron Today</h2>
                <p>Acheron's crust is composed of aluminium silicates. Although there are signs of past volcanic
                    activity, there is no evidence of any current volcanic or tectonic processes on the surface.
                    However, the moon's core still remains active.</p>

                <h2>What is Terraforming?</h2>
                <p>Terraforming is the process of changing the climate and ecology of a planet or moon to support life
                    in Earth-like conditions. The process can take up to 20 years. The Weyland Corporation was one of
                    the first corporations to achieve this.</p>
