                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>Acheron received its current name by the humans who settled there. The name may be a reference to the
                    river Acheron (“the river of woe”) in the underworld from Greek mythology, where souls of the dead
                    were carried across. In Dante's Inferno, the Acheron River forms a border around Hell.</p>

                <h2>Hadley's Hope</h2>
                <p>Hadley's Hope—a terraforming, research, and mining colony—settled on Acheron in 2157 to make it
                    suitable for human habitation. The colony was small with a strong sense of community. Most of the
                    colonists were families searching for a better life. In 2179, an outbreak of Xenomorphs ultimately
                    destroyed the settlement, with Rebecca “Newt” Jorden being the sole survivor. Although Acheron has
                    no human settlements today, the efforts of Hadley's Hope showed that it can be done. Their legacy
                    lives on. </p>

                <h2>Ellen Ripley</h2>
                <p>The history of Acheron cannot be told without honoring the courage of Ellen Ripley, who is a symbol
                    of heroism, survival, and resilience. She survived many Xenomorph encounters in her lifetime. In
                    2179, she joined a mission to investigate the disappearance of Hadley's Hope. Ripley risked
                    everything to save the child and only survivor of the colony. Her life ended in self-sacrifice, so
                    that others could live.</p>
